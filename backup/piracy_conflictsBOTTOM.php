	Never before in history have the ramifications of a monarch's command stretched to every corner of the globe; this was in large
	part due to the massive expansion of imperial possessions carved in the previous era.<center></p>
	<p><center>In this section, all piracy and conflicts of inter-European affairs are discussed and analyized.

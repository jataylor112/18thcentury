# 18thcentury Website
This project is a sample website demonstrating aesthetic design, database connectivity, profile creation, and various usages of web technologies. Additional credit goes to Katie McGrath for assistance in SQL stored procedures and table layout.

Note: The "connection.php" file must be placed inside the htdocs folder (this project was created using XAMPP) rather than the root project folder for security purposes. It has been placed in this position on Github to give you access to the file.

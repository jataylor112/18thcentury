    <p><center>The 18th century was home to various amounts of ramphage and engagements that shaped the foundation of the post-modern world.
	From the continental shifts of warring powers to reform in battle formations, the globe was drastically altered!
	Never before in history have the ramifications of a monarch's command stretched to every corner of the globe; this was in large
	part due to the massive expansion of imperial possessions carved in the previous era.<center></p>
	<p><center>In this section, all piracy and conflicts of inter-European affairs are discussed and analyized.
	For national conflicts, go to "<a href="nations_empires.html" id="nations_empires">Nations | Empires</a>" then click
	on your nation of choice!<center></p>
